# Hotel Booking Data Analysis

This project involves an in-depth analysis of hotel booking data to uncover key insights and trends that can help hotel managers optimize operations, improve customer satisfaction, and increase revenue. The dataset includes various attributes such as booking status, arrival date, customer demographics, and more.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to analyze hotel booking patterns, cancellations, and customer behavior to provide actionable insights. The analysis covers data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization to tell a compelling story about the hotel's booking data.

## Key Objectives

- **Understand Booking Patterns:** Analyze booking trends over time to identify peak periods and potential opportunities for pricing optimization.
- **Identify Factors Influencing Cancellations:** Investigate the key factors that lead to booking cancellations and propose strategies to reduce them.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Segment customers based on booking behaviors and demographics to tailor marketing efforts effectively.
- **Revenue Optimization:** Analyze the Average Daily Rate (ADR) and suggest strategies for maximizing revenue during low-demand periods.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains 119,390 records with 32 variables, including:

- **Hotel Type:** City Hotel or Resort Hotel
- **Booking Information:** Arrival dates, booking lead times, number of nights stayed, etc.
- **Customer Demographics:** Number of adults, children, and babies
- **Booking Status:** Canceled or not canceled
- **Special Requests:** Number of special requests made by customers

## Data Wrangling

- **Handling Missing Values:** Filled missing values in critical columns such as `children` with 0 where applicable.
- **Data Type Corrections:** Converted date-related fields (`arrival_date` and `reservation_status_date`) to datetime objects.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features such as `total_guests` and `total_stays` to facilitate deeper analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualizations

The project includes 13 visualizations that explore relationships between variables and draw meaningful insights, such as:

1. **Line Chart: Booking Trends Over Time** - Revealed seasonal trends and peak booking periods.
2. **Box Plot: ADR Distribution by Customer Type** - Showed variations in ADR across different customer segments.
3. **Heatmap: Cancellations by Month and Hotel Type** - Identified months with the highest cancellation rates and highlighted differences between city and resort hotels.
4. **Scatter Plot: ADR vs. Total Stays** - Demonstrated the correlation between the length of stay and the average daily rate.
5. **Violin Plot: Length of Stay by Hotel Type** - Visualized the distribution of stay durations for city versus resort hotels.

## Key Insights

- **High Cancellation Rates in City Hotels:** City hotels have a 30% higher cancellation rate compared to resort hotels, suggesting a need for more flexible booking policies.
- **Seasonal Booking Peaks:** Identified that July and August are peak booking months, presenting an opportunity for dynamic pricing.
- **Direct Bookings Yield Higher Revenue:** Direct bookings have a 50% higher ADR compared to bookings through agents, indicating potential for revenue maximization by promoting direct booking channels.
- **Impact of Lead Time on Cancellations:** Longer lead times are associated with higher cancellation rates, highlighting the importance of offering incentives for last-minute bookings.

## Business Recommendations

- **Implement Flexible Cancellation Policies:** To reduce cancellations, especially in city hotels.
- **Leverage Seasonal Pricing Strategies:** Maximize revenue during peak seasons with dynamic pricing.
- **Promote Direct Booking Channels:** To capitalize on higher ADR from direct bookings.
- **Targeted Marketing for High-ADR Customers:** Focus on attracting customer segments that yield the highest revenue.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Used for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Google Colab**: For code execution and collaboration.
